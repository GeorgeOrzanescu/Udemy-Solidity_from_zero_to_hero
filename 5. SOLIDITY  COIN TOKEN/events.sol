/*
Events in Solidity act like the logging functionality that youâ€™re used to with other languages, 
except that instead of logging to the console or to a file, 
the logs are saved in the Ethereum blockchain. 

1. The definition of the event contains the name of the event and the parameters you want to save when you trigger the event.
2. Once you have declared your event, you can emit an event from within a function!
